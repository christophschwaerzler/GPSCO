GPS Controlled Oscillator: A simple GPS based manual calibration method for a 10 MHz oscillator using the 1 pps signal.

This is NOT another GPSDO, but rather a rock bottom method for manually calibrating an OCXO such
as one of these bargain kits incorporating a high quality CTI OSC5A2B and which are available from various online stores:

These kits have a trimmer which sets the voltage for the VCXO and thus the exact frequency. They come preadjusted, but one can still improve the precision by calibrating the OCXO.
